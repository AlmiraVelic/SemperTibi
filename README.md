<h2 align="left"> Problem definition</h2>
Mental health is becoming an increasing issue as nearly a fifth of the population in high income countries have mental disorders. People are facing the fact, that they must ensure more tasks in less time. They for example do battle with fatigue symptoms over the time and feal burned out. People’s mood and thoughts, when having mental health issues, often lead to problems in daily tasks, work and study. Finding help although is sometimes not that easy, as there are people living far away from any therapist, the therapy is too expensive, or have among other problems also time constraints, as well as concerns about confidentiality. 
As the usage of mobile apps has expanded widely to many users also mental health apps play a huge therapeutic part nowadays. There are more than 10000 apps available that help with the daily mental health and wellness. There are apps that constantly interact with the user to ask about their overall well-being several times a day and make suggestions on how to reduce the stress level or have a better sleep. This helps people to self-manage their personal mental health conditions and supplements in some kind a psychiatric treatment.  
Mental illnesses are unfortunately stigmatised in society and those affected, who make their problems and illnesses public, are often shunned, or ridiculed by their social environment. It is therefore particularly important to protect this highly sensitive data through data security aspects (security, privacy, safety) and a consistent concept. Researchers have found out that many apps do not focus on the data security at all or only poorly. Even apps with no encryption at all have been found on the market.

<h2 align="left"> Goals of the project</h2>
The goal of this project is to implement a mental health application on an android smartphone, that tracks the mental health in special concerns on the stress level of a user. To ensure data security of the stored data a stable backend solution with data encryption needs to be developed. As finalization of the project, the master thesis for achieving the Master of Science in Engineering will be written. 

<h2 align="left"> Methods</h2>
For reaching the goals of the project, research on the effects of prolonged mental stress and associated incipient burnout symptoms (e.g., emotional exhaustion, listlessness to participate in different activities, feeling of emptiness and lack of perspective, loss of self-esteem and reduction of performance in private and professional contexts as well as social isolation) needs to be done in first place. It is necessary to also describe the meaning of stress. The question on what happens to the body and the psyche when facing different kind of stress (positive stress, everyday stress, long-term stress up to a burnout symptom) need to be analysed.
Furthermore, research on technical assistance systems for people with mental health problems will be needed. Therefore, market research will be done for the state-of-the-art apps being used for relaxation as well as sensor technology for measuring physical symptoms of stress (e.g., increased pulse and blood pressure values, muscle tension).
A conceptual design of an Android-based application for stress monitoring as well as assisting functions to find a way out of short-lived stress situations. The technical support system should show people which situations trigger stress in their individual context as a preventive measure. Furthermore, the system helps users with their own stress management to better handle incipient excessive demands on their own.
Regarding authorisation, authentication, secure data transmission and storage, the topic of data security is chosen as the focus of the evaluation to show how different interfaces (smartphone application, data storage on a backend server, optional sensor technology to measure physical characteristics of stress) can be designed securely based on the implemented application example.   

<h2 align="left"> Research questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>What effects does permanent stress have on the body (physical and mental symptoms) or performance?</li>
<li>What interventions and derived functions (design & functionality) can be used to support one's own stress management and, beyond that, mental health?</li>
<li>Which vital parameters can be validly used as automated indicators of stress?</li>
<li>What data security measures need to be set for a mental health support mobile app?</li>
<li>What could a data security concept for the mobile mental health app for frontend and backend look like?</li>
</ol>

<h2 align="left"> Current Results </h2>
The Name for the application has been chosen to be fitted to the mental health topic. Its name is “semper tibi” which is the meaning for “always with you” on latin language. 
Literature research, the set-up of the development environment as well as the preparation of the mock-up for the App have been finished. 
The project status is “In time”, so there are no obstacles or any risks that the project cannot be finished by Summersemester 2023.
