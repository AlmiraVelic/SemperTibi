    <string name="explanation" tools:ignore="ExtraTranslation">The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in oneâ€™s life are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress. The PSS was designed for use in community samples with at least a junior high school education. The items are easy to understand, and the response alternatives are simple to grasp. Moreover, the questions are of a general nature and hence are relatively free of content specific to any subpopulation group. The questions in the PSS ask about feelings and thoughts during the last month.</string>
    <string name="answerPSS1">Never</string>
    <string name="answerPSS2">Almost never</string>
    <string name="answerPSS3">Sometimes</string>
    <string name="answerPSS4">Fairly often</string>
    <string name="answerPSS5">Very often</string>
    <string name="outputPSS1">Your test results indicate that you had low stress the last month. Keep this pace in life! You are doing a great job!</string>
    <string name="outputPSS2">Your test results indicate that you had moderate stress the last month. Please try to reduce your stress level. See the Tipps and Tricks for more information on how to self-control the stress. </string>
    <string name="outputPSS3">Your test results indicate that you had high perceived stress the last month. Check your health status at a medical institution as soon as you feel uncomfortable.</string>
